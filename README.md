# minesweeper

The project imitates the old game "minesweeper". 
There are 10 bombs randomly generated on the game board and the user needs to avoid them. 
He can also place flags on the boxes he suspects to be hiding bombs. 
Managing to clear the table without touching any bombs means victory for the player.
